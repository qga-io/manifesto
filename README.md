# Manifesto v1.0
[We](https://qga.io) believe blockchain and cryptocurrencies are more than meme tokens, rug pulls, scams, signal groups, and trading. The new dynamics of the market have convinced everyone that the purpose of cryptocurrencies is to earn fast profits. Therefore, whenever a new investor loses money, they blame the technology. This situation hurts the reputation of honest projects.

Our first goal is education — to teach everyone about blockchain technology. To do this, we believe we must step out of our echo chambers. If we want a revolution, we should start decentralizing every single Web2 alternative, and explore tokenizing every possible project. However, NFTs and cliché meme tokens are not the way.

This is why qga.io wants to be the gate between Web2 and Web3. We obviously cannot convert to Web3 all at once, our moves must be step by step.

## What we are against
There are a couple of habits in the ecosystem we are fundamentally against.

### Ignorance
We are against any kind of ignorance. Every human being has ignorance in it. It is not possible to learn everything about anything. But, we believe that we should learn as much as we can. A proper education can heal the world. Not talking about schools, not talking about useless courses. It is a broader saying. Ignorance is not limited to blockchain, we want to fix the system.

### Memecoins
Memecoins weren’t a problem when they first appeared. However, they started to hurt the ecosystem and reputation of blockchain by easing the scams. A token with a solid project built by blockchain developers is less likely to be a scam compared to meme tokens created in minutes. Most of them don't have any real purpose. They make people think cryptocurrencies are just a way to gamble instead of being a powerful technology. We're against this kind of hype because it distracts from real, useful projects.

It's never too late to convert your meme project into a useful project. Even though it may have started as a meme, project owners can contribute to the improvement of the ecosystem with their existing audience.

### Scams and Rug Pulls
It is impossible to remove scams out of this world completely. People tend to believe what they want to hear, there will always be scams. Furthermore, there will always be new ways to waste your hard-earned money. Education can fix that problem. If all investors, blockchain enthusiasts, and simply everybody who has something to do with cryptocurrencies knew about popular scam techniques, it would be simpler to protect your money.

## What we support
We support anyone:
- Who has the desire to learn
- Who contributes to blockchain, open-source, education, and finance
- Who wants to teach other people what they know
- Who aims to improve the blockchain ecosystem and eliminate scams

## But, who are we?
We are [qga.io](https://qga.io). A community that wants to fix the system and reduce ignorance. An ecosystem of technologies designed to fulfill the dreams outlined in this manifesto.

Stay safe.
